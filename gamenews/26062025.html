	<h2>The Score System!</h2>

	<p>Due to being (sadly) busy with other things, a smaller and delayed update, but!</p>

        <h4>Introducing the score system!(Beta)</h4>

        <p>The score system is a new feature in Platformer 02, where your skills FINALLY come to the test! It starts off with a default score of 100000, but several factors will help in lowering that score! The factors, to be exact, are... </p>

        <h4>TIME<h4>
                <p>THe main objective for a level that you play, is how quickly you finish the level. For every second you waste, or spend wisely... whatever... you lose 100 points.</p>

        <h4>MEDAL</h4>
                <p>Connected to how fast you complete the level, here's how many points you will lose when you get a medal:</p>
                        <h4>GOLD: 5000 points</h4>
                        <h4>SILVER: 10000 points</h4>
                        <h4>BRONZE: 15000 points</h4>
                        <h4>Or, if you suck so badly you didn't even get a medal(no offense, you can try again): 25000 points</h4>
