	 <h1>An update on the score system!</h1>
	 <p>I've added(and am going to add) some new information related to the score system, and here are the changes!</p>
	 
	 <h4>Introducing tokens!</h4>
	 <p>I have not developed them to that level yet, but tokens are an in-game collectible which, as of now, will only increase your score!(And this is also yet to be finalized, since I have not added them in all the levels yet.)<p>

	 <h4>Stars?</h4>
	 <p>Not yet finalized, but I will also be adding stars which will be an extra flex alongside your high score!</p>

	 <h4>Other bug fixes:</h4>
	 <li>Made sure data loss chance is reduced with a better save system!</li>
	 <li>Also removed the chance of getting a negative score, which, will lead to a gamebreaking bug that will get the game stuck at the level complete screen.</li>
