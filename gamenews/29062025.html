	<h1>Two month anniversary!</h1>
	<p>This is huge for me, I never would have thought I would have made it this far! So today, I will be adding a new robo...</p>

	<h4>Introducing the Cakebot!</h4>
	<img src="../images/charonly/cakebot.jpg" alt="Cakebot!">
	<p>Nothing much is known about him, so don't just blindly trust his smile... But, on a serious note, I will not just reveal how will be unlocked... ah yes this made me remember something...</p>

	<h4>Star thresholds!</h4>
	<p>Star thresholds have now been declared for all levels! And now, even though for now this is for Green World levels only, you can see how many stars you have for each level, underneath the disk!</p>

	<h4>Small update on tokens!</h4>
	<p>I will now also be adding token collectibles in every other level, so then the entire score logic can work flawlessly! But, it will take some time, so bear with me please...</h4>
