	 <h1>What are the different mechanics in the game?</h1>
	 <p>These mechanics are really simple, but don't be fooled...</p>

	</div>

	<h3>The Block!</h3>
	<p>The classic block, it always stays there... waiting for you to stay on it...</p>

	<h3>The Jump Block!</h3>
	<img src="images/mechonly/jumpblock.jpg" alt="Jump Block!">
	<p>When you get on the jump block, you get thrown up high, maybe even higher depending on your gravity...</p>>

	<h3>The Moving Block!</h3>
	<img src="images/mechonly/moveblock.jpg" alt="Moving Block!">
	<p>This block moves back and forth... but the player needs to move alongside it as well! For now though...

	<h3>The Coin and the Locked Block!</h3>
	<img src="images/mechonly/coin.jpg" alt="Coin!">	<img src="images/mechonly/lockedblock.jpg" alt="Locked Block!">
	<p>For this block, you have to find a coin to unlock it! But... be careful! If you die, you will have to get the coin again!</p>

	<h3>Deceivers!</h3>
	<img src="images/mechonly/deceivers.jpg" alt="Deceivers!">
	<p>These are not saws... these are invisible blocks... trust me bro...</p>

	<h3>Checkpoints!</h3>
	<img src="images/mechonly/yellow_flag.png" alt="Inactive Checkpoint">		<img src="images/mechonly/green_flag.png" alt="Active Checkpoint!">
	<p>The Yellow Flag is when a checkpoint is not currently active! But if it was once active and a Green Flag, then it will not be active again!</p>
